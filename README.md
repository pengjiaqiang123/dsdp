This is an efficient optimization technique for super-resolution 2-D harmonic retrieval, named decoupled atomic norm minimization (D-ANM). 

State-of-the-art 2-D ANM approach vectorizes the 2-D measurement to a 1-D equivalence, which incurs huge computational cost in 2-D processing, making it infeasible in real applications. We develop a novel decoupled approach of 2-D ANM via semi-definite programming (SDP), which introduces a new atom set to naturally decouple the joint observation in both dimensions without loss of optimality. Accordingly, the original large-scale 2-D problem is equivalently reformulated via two decoupled one-level Toeplitz matrices, which can be solved by simple 1-D frequency estimation with automatic pairing. 

Compared with the conventional vectorized approach, the proposed technique reduces the computational complexity from the order of O(N^3.5 M^3.5) to O((N +M)^3.5), where N and M are the problem size on the two dimensions respectively. 

It also retains the benefits of ANM in terms of super-resolution, small number of required measurements and robustness to source correlation.
